quote: Yhwach, the world that you desired to create may indeed have been devoid of fear. However, in a world without the fear of death, men could not face that fear and seek out hope. Certainly, they could keep walking onward by merely living, but that would be very different from walking onward while conquering their own fears. That is why we give the act of walking onward a special name. We call it 'courage'.

about: The quote matters to me because it argues that fear, struggle, and mortality are what give rise to courage, urgency, and meaningful direction in life.
