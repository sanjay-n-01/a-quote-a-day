quote: “Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.”
author: Albert Einstein 
what_it_means_to_me: This quote reminds me to stay humble and not take myself or the world too seriously. It highlights how humans are capable of making endless mistakes, and adopting a sense of humor about our flaws can help navigate life's absurdities with patience instead of frustration.
