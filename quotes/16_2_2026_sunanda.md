quote: So often, a visit to a bookshop has cheered me, and remainded me that there are good things in the world.
author: Vincent Van Gogh 
what_it_means_to_me:  A bookshop is more than just a place to sell books. It is the place where the heart of pages printed in ink beat and the soul and spirit lifts up to a high cheerful mood. It gives us a reassurance that the world still holds beauty and goodness in it.
